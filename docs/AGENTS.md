# docs/AGENTS.md

This folder contains concise, agent-focused documentation. Keep these files short and aligned with the codebase.

## Index

- `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` explains what the app does and its dependencies.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` maps UI layout, state slices, and service boundaries.
- `docs/DATA_FLOW.md` traces query, plan, catalog, and chat flows.

## Update guidance

- If routes, APIs, or core flows change, update these docs.
- Prefer linking to code paths instead of duplicating large code blocks.
